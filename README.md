# BOWSER-ENGINE

### Enquire

Bowser-engine is a game engine based on an exciting open source technology called [WebGL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebGL). More precisely it's based on [three.js](http://www.threejs.org), a library that takes out a lot of WebGL's boilerplate allowing us to focus on the gaming part. More broad information can be found on our [website](http://www.bowserjs.org).

Bowser-engine is a node package currently meant to be browserified and served client side. It's a collection of objects using prototypal inheritance. To have a good overview of the API please refere to this [article](http://bowserjs.org/learn/bowser-engine-api).

We are very kean to have people collaborating, whether it is by pointing at issues, sharing ideas, issuing pull requests or ultimatly becoming official members.

### Comply

Good collaboration does not go well without clear guidelines and organisation. This is why we will take advantage of this readme file to outline some of that stuff.

* Indentation is made out of four spaces.
* Code is formated matching [JSLint](http://www.jslint.com/) standards.
* In line documentation follows JSDoc markup.
* Comments are one liners starting with a capital and ending with a dot.
* Git commits are one liners starting with a capital and ending without ponctuation.
* A base class becomes folder. Sub-classes live in that folder.
* We host a single class per source file.
* Source files export the class itself.
* When a package is required it is declared uppercase.

It goes without saying that all guidelines are up for discussions. If something can be done in a way that is substantialy better, there is no reason to keep doing it.
